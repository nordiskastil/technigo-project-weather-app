# Weather app

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Brief description of the assignment:
Create a weather using the fetch() function in JavaScript to load the weather data into your page. Present some data on your web app: 
the city name
the temperature
and what type of weather it is
sunset and sunrise

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
I got the API-key, changed the city to Östersund and tested it. In the HTML file I connected the JavaScript and CSS and added some basic text. The next step was to create variables for the API Key and city. I had to find help online to convert the date, temperature and time and make it readable. I adjusted the time from hh:mm:ss to only hh:mm. Then I used CSS to style the app. I used the SVG icons from the example but added one for snow, because we still get snow in April here in Jämtland. 

- If you had more time, what would be next?
Some more styling. I tried to add another city and geolocation but did't get it to work right now.
