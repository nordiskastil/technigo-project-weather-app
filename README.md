# Weather app

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Brief description of the assignment
Create a weather using the fetch() function in JavaScript to load the weather data into your page. Present some data on your web app: 
the city name
the temperature
and what type of weather it is
sunset and sunrise

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
I got the API-key and tested it. I had to find help online to convert the date, temperature and time and make it readable. I adjusted the time from hh:mm:ss to only hh:mm. Then I added the internal HTML and CSS to style the app. 

- If you had more time, what would be next?
Some more styling, maybe try to add another city.
